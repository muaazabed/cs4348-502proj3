Time to begin. A little dogged with other stuff is why I'm starting now. Oops. But yeah, I'll have to start with the UI--I need it to test the program functionality, after all. Then I'll begin implementing functionality. This project doesn't seem as bad as the other ones, so I figure I should be able to get this in by midnight. I've already done some of the project, but ig I can just add it to this repo as it's done.

Just got back from lunch and finished the menu. Next, I'll try to get the file access and parsing working. Hopefully this should be easy, as I've got a lot of experience building crappy little parsers.
